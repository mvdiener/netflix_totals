# Reeces Pieces Rules

A small program to calculate the % chance of an empty bag, when eating Reeces Pieces according to my very specific rules. The rules are as follows:

Pick 3 pieces from the bag.
You must eat all three if the colors are the same, or all three colors are different.
If two of the colors are the same, the odd color must be put back in the bag.

To run program, call runPercentages(num) where num is the amount of times you want to run the program. Uses a set of 1000 pieces as a sample size.
